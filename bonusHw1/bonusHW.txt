2) In the simulation model of the producer-consumer, would the full and empty
semaphores be necessary if the buffer had a single slot? Explain. Implement the
changes in the simulation model.
Write pseudocode for both consumer and producer. 
Problem: Suppose there the buffer has only 1 slot, which could only store 1 data item. Could you rewrite the producer and consumer code with at most 2 semaphores?

If there is only a sigle slot then we do not need a full or empty semaphore

Pseudocode: 

Semaphores produces, consumer;

int buffer = 1;

producer.num = 1;
consumer.num = 1;

while(true){ //Code for producer

signal(consumer); // send signal to consumer to empty out buffer
wait(consumer); //wait till consumer finishes

}

while(true){

wait(producer); //wait for producer to send the signal
signal(producer); //empty the buffer

}
