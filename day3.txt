Quiz on feb 2: Topics: chapter 2,3 and 4. MOSTLY chapter 3 and 4.

-You don't have to memorize linux commands, just know what they do.


Chapter 2: Review

-Chapter 2 is super important (professor said this)

-When do we create a process?
--Process is created when the job comes into the queue, then they decides whether we can create a process for it. We much determine if we have the memory to run the process.

-Life cycle of process
--There is a queue before the process is created to hold the jobs that are trying to be made into process, then when the process is created then we have a queue to process the processes.

High priority processes get run first

PCB
--descriptor for the process

IO devices

Scheduler

Process vs thread
Some processes can have one or more threads
A thread is a lightweight process, thread is a fine grain unit, but process is the fundamental unit for computing
This is because the operating system gives the process memory to execute it.

Thread has state, ID, variables.

Types of threads:
-User level threads
-Kernel level threads.





Chapter 3:  Systems and Models

-System is the part of the real world under study. It has entities interacting among themselves
-Model is abstract representation of the system.
-System has structure and behavior.
-Model depends on the passage of time, input data and the events made by the environment

Types of models: Physical, graphical and mathematical models: Mathematical models are the most flexible ones, its the best way to understand models

Mathematical models:
-Analytic, numeric, deterministic and stochastic models.

Deterministic models:
-Models that have a completely predictable dehavior (100% certainty)
-Stochastic modeks: models that display uncertainty.

Stochastic models:
-Implemented as random variables, values change according to some probability distribution

Random Variables:
-Values that change randomly based on mathematical computations taking place in the model.


COntinuous models and Discrete models
-Change their state continuously with time.
-Discrete models change their states in a limited time.

Simulation results
-2 TYPES OF OUTPUTS
--Trace and performance measures

Modeling nd simulation are used to study the different components and various aspects of an operating systems

Performance measures:

Measures indicate how good or bad the systems are carrying out their functions with some aspect.
Usually several performance measures are necessary


Performance:
Goals that can be measures without looking at the internals of the systems example:
-Maximize work performed (Throughtput)
-Minimize response time
-fairness

Performance goals
-For subsystems internal to the computer
Examples:
	-Maximize cpu time
		--Time the cpu is busy
	-Maximize disk utilization
		--Time disk is busy
	-Minimize disk access time
		--time it takes to perform a disk request

ABSTRACTION----(IMPORTANT)
-It is a high level description of object

Workload Parameters:Look on slide
System Parameters:Look on slide

More memory = more processes can be run

Arrival rate is the time between 22 resource requests arriving
Arrival rate = 1/Arrival Interval

Service Time is the time to actually perform a request
Service Rate = 1/Service time
--Denoted by mew
--eg: 2 requests/second

Arrival Rate<Service rate //Look on slide to see what happens
Arrival Rate = Service rate //Look on slide

Service time: Is the service time for a given request always the same?
--It can vary

Bottleneck
-The computer system reaches capacity when one of more of its servers or recources reach a utilization is close to 100%

Bottleneck of the computer system described can be localized at the processor

Multi-programming
-In most computer systems, the io controllers enable a system to overlap device i/o operation with processor operation.
-This results in a more effecient utilization of the system facilities
-Processor ultilization and I/O device utilization is higher
